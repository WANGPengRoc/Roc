Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, majoring in atmospheric science. My interests include
climate change, ENSO variability and teleconnection. I am not so skillful in programming, but I still hope my sharing may help
you. BTW, GitHub can be very useful to manage my research project.
